.net Test Applications
=====

There's always that moment when you realize you could just write something to do 'that'--well, that's what's going in here.  These apps aren't necessarily for demonstration purposes, but have a usecase and a niche where it was just faster to write one than to try to find something off the shelf.  Alternatively, there's always that moment in every developer's life where you say something stupid like 'I could do that better' and end up spending far too much time on a widget that says "hello world."  Hopefully this collection of projects is far more of the former, and far fewer of the latter.  Each project will be accompanied with its own README.md explaining the usecase and how the configuration of the application affects its behavior.
